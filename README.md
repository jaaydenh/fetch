Fetch
=====

Fetch is a fast paced educational language learning game for iOS. The objective is to answer the questions as quickly as possible to earn the highest number of points. The questions are all presented in the foreign language the player is expected to be learning and require the player to find one or more objects in the gameplay area. The questions range from finding an object by name to finding a set of objects by a category in classification such as color, type, size, purpose, quantity, etc.

The goal of the game is to improve vocabulary in a selected foreign language while maintaining a high fun factor that will increase continued engagement with the game.

This project is currently in early stage development.
